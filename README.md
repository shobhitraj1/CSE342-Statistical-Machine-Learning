# CSE342-Statistical-Machine-Learning

ðŸ“˜ **Course Overview:** <br>
This repository contains my coursework (assignments, semester exams &amp; project) for the [Statistical Machine Learning](https://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE342) course at IIIT Delhi in Winter 2024. <br>
The course covers key topics in machine learning and pattern classification. Fundamentals and advanced theoretical and mathematical concepts related to classification techniques and learning paradigms are covered in this course.

ðŸ“‚ **Folder Structure:**
- `/Assignment 1`: This folder includes assignment 1, it's official solution and my solutions are also included.
- `/Assignment 2`: This folder includes assignment 2 codes, it was about applying QDA & PCA on the MNIST dataset & making handwritten digit recognition classifier model.
- `/Assignment 3`: This folder includes assignment 3 codes, it was about learning a decision tree from the MNIST dataset and then use ensemble learning using bagging with decision trees to make a classifier model.
- `/Assignment 4`: This folder includes assignment 4 codes, it was about implementing Boosting techniques. The first task was to apply AdaBoost.M1 algorithm on the MNIST dataset for binary classification of digits 0 and 1. The second task was to apply gradient boosting with absolute loss to a regression problem.
- `/Project`: will add soon.
- `/Exams`: will add soon.
